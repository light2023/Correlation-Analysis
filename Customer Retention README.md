- Total charges and monthly charges are tracked for each customer, providing insight into their payment habits.
###  Recommendations for Improving Customer Retention
### Incentivize Long-Term Contracts:
- - Since a large portion of customers are on month-to-month contracts, offering discounts
- or additional benefits for switching to longer-term contracts (one or two years) could increase customer retention.This could reduce churn and provide more stability in revenue.
### Enhance Senior Citizen Engagement:
- With a significant number of senior citizens in the customer base, tailor services or create special packages that cater specifically to their needs.
- This could include simpler service options, dedicated customer support lines, or loyalty programs that reward long-term engagement.
### Improve Customer Support:
- The high number of admin and tech tickets suggests that customers may be facing issues with their services. Implementing more robust self-service options, improving response times, and offering proactive customer support could help reduce these ticket volumes and improve overall customer satisfaction.
Bundling Services for Increased Value:
- Customers are using a variety of services (phone, internet, security, etc.).
-  Consider offering bundled service packages at a discounted rate to increase the perceived value and encourage customers to subscribe to multiple services, thereby increasing their loyalty.
### Automate Payment Processes:
- Encourage customers to use automated payment methods like bank transfers or credit card payments to ensure timely payments and reduce churn due to missed payments.
- This can be promoted by offering small incentives, such as discounts on the next billing cycle for switching to automated payments.
### Targeted Marketing and Promotions:
- Use the insights from the demographic data to create targeted marketing campaigns.
  For example, offer special promotions for different customer segments,
  such as discounts for new customers or exclusive deals for customers nearing the end of their current contracts.
### Monitor and Reduce Churn:
- Regularly monitor the churn rate and identify patterns that lead to customer attrition.
- Implement early intervention strategies for at-risk customers, such as personalized outreach or offers designed to retain them before they decide to leave.
- By implementing these recommendations, PWC can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn, and improve overall retention, leading to increased revenue and profitability.

### 7. Conclusion
This dashboard provides a clear view of customer retention metrics and highlights areas where improvements can be made.
By focusing on the KPIs, PWC can devise strategies to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn, and ultimately increase profitability.
