# Correlation-Analysis
 This project analyzes the correlation between key economic variables like M1 money supply, exchange rates, stock market performance, and inflation for Nigeria. Visualizations, time-shifted correlations, and theoretical insights are provided.  Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
## Objectives
Analyze the relationships between economic variables.
Investigate potential time-lagged effects.
Provide theoretical insights into observed correlations.
## Key Features
Data Collection: Historical data on economic indicators.
Visualizations: Scatter plots and heatmaps to represent correlations.
Correlation Analysis: Calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients.
Time-Shifted Analysis: Examining how correlations change over time.
## Tools & Technologies
Python: For data processing and analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: For data handling and numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
## Results
The analysis provides insights into the relationships between the selected economic variables, with a focus on identifying patterns and potential time-lagged effects.
